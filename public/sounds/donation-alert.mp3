# This is a placeholder for the donation alert sound file
# In a real implementation, you would add an actual MP3 file here
# You can use free sounds from sites like:
# - freesound.org
# - zapsplat.com  
# - Adobe Audition's built-in sounds
# 
# For now, this serves as a reference for where the sound file should be placed
